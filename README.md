# Data Structures and Algorithms in C#
I did [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-deep-dive-using-java/) on Udemy but it was all in Java so I converted it all to C#.

I am taking suggestions on how to improve it. I thought about converting all of my notes into markdown for this README. But, I feel that I already pretty much got everything absorbed through my notes and two implementations so I may just leave it how it is.

Thanks for stopping by! :-)
